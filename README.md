# mfriik/dnd5e-quickref

A compact, printable and browser-friendly quick reference sheet for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition — supporting both 2014 rules and a 2024 rules update. This project is a personalized fork that builds on top of earlier community work to provide a useful, easy-to-edit reference for players and GMs.

## What this is

- A single-page quick reference for common D&D 5e rules, actions, combat steps, conditions, and other frequently used information.
- Lightweight, static HTML/CSS/JS — easy to host (GitHub Pages or any static host).
- Customizable: the sheet content is stored in simple JavaScript data files so you can add or change entries without modifying markup.

## Quick features

- Compact layout optimized for quick scanning at the table. Now with Collapsible sections
- Toggles to enable homebrew rules and optional rules.
- Dark mode enabled.
- Easy Switch between 2024 and 2014 Rulesets

## Editing the sheet

- The content lives in the `js` folder. Edit the `data` files there to:
  - Add or change actions
  - Add custom notes or house rules
  - Add new sections
- No build step required — changes in the `js` files are reflected immediately in the page.

## Repository layout (high level)

- img/ — icons and images
